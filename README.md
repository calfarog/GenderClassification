There are two sets (directories), one for the scripts and one for the data. In the data folder 
there are the RData files with the data frames and required functions for running the main script.
In that folder, there are two files, one for the Spanish biographies and the other for English biographies.

In the functions folder there are five scripts: 
- exploratoryAnalysis.R: This script contains the functions to analyze the biographies.
- packageInstallation.R: This script contains for installing some required packages. 
- plots.R: This script contains the function to create the comparison plot for f1 score.
- scrappy.R: This script contains the functions to retrieve the biographies from Wikipedia.
- textClassification.R: This script contains the functions required for text classification.
